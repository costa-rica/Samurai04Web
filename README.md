# TypeScriptNextJsDashboard

## Overview

This is a starter project for a dashboard application built with Next.js and TypeScript. It will use Tailwind CSS for styling and Redux Toolkit for state management. The navigation and folder structure will use App Router.

### Overview TL;DR

- started from `npx create-next-app@latest`
  - No Turbopack -> this causes problems with the svg icons (src/icons)
- Heavily lifting the architecture from [free-nextjs-admin-dashboard-main](https://tailadmin.com/download)
- Customizeing it to fit the needs of the NewsNexus Portal.
- Uses App Router
- Uses TailwindCSS
- Uses Redux for state management
- Uses TypeScript
